# Atomic Design System - Modern Service Page Templates

## Overview

This document outlines the redesigned atomic design system for Intellectt's service pages. The system provides modern, conversion-optimized templates that are emotionally engaging and visually stunning.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **High-end & Tech-forward**: Modern aesthetics inspired by Apple, Linear, Stripe
- **Emotionally Resonant**: Content that connects with users on a deeper level
- **Business Conversion Focused**: Every element optimized for lead generation
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design that works perfectly on all devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant with proper contrast and navigation
- **Performance**: Fast loading with optimized assets and lazy loading

### Visual Style
- **Typography**: Modern sans-serif (Inter, Satoshi, DM Sans)
- **Color Scheme**: Dark/light mode variants with high contrast
- **Gradients**: Used sparingly, primarily on CTAs
- **Animations**: Subtle motion on scroll with smooth transitions
- **Icons**: Minimalist, uniform vector-based iconography

## Atomic Components
